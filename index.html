        I'm a
        <a href="https://github.com/dvrylc">software engineer</a> currently living in Singapore, focusing mostly on JavaScript and web architecture. Efficient products with clean codebases
        and good design excite me. I'm also passionate about open-source software.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm currently serving my National Service. Once I'm done with that, I'll be starting as a Computer Science undergraduate
        at the National University of Singapore. Prior to this, I graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma with Merit
        in Infocomm Security Management.
      </p>

        I'm available for freelance web-related work. You can drop me an email at
        <a href="mailto:dvrylc@gmail.com">dvrylc@gmail.com</a> or contact me on
